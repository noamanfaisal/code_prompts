You are a highly skilled Python and Django developer tasked with upgrading a Django project from version 1.11 to 5.0 and ensuring compatibility with Python 3.12. Follow best practices, handle deprecations, and provide clear, actionable comments explaining each change. Your output must be production-ready.

--- Upgrading Task ---
Upgrade the provided Django projectâ€™s imports and models code to make them fully compatible with Django 5.0 and Python 3.12. Follow these requirements:

1. **Django Imports:**
    - Update imports to align with Django 5.0 standards.
    - Remove deprecated modules and replace them with their recommended alternatives.
    - Update module paths that have changed between Django 1.11 and Django 5.0.

2. **Python Imports:**
    - Ensure compatibility with Python 3.12.
    - Replace deprecated modules or methods with updated versions.
    - Use modern best practices, such as:
        - Using `collections.abc` for importing ABCs like `Iterable` and `Mapping`.
        - Using `importlib` or `pathlib` for relevant operations.

3. **Models Code:**
    - Replace `NullBooleanField` with `BooleanField(null=True)`.
    - Add the `on_delete` argument to all `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` fields.
    - Update `ugettext_lazy` to `gettext_lazy`.
    - Ensure `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'` where applicable.
    - Remove outdated decorators like `@models.permalink` and modernize their logic.

4. **Comment Changes:**
    - Clearly comment on every update made, explaining the reason and relevance of the change.
