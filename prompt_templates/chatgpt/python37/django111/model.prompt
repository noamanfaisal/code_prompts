# Prompt for Upgrading Django Models (Code Chunks)

## Task:
Review and rewrite the provided **code chunk** from `models.py` to make it fully compatible with **Django 5.0** and **Python 3.12**.

### Requirements:
1. **Review and Update:**
   - Analyze the provided code, whether it's a complete file, a class, or individual methods, and rewrite it for compatibility with Django 5.0.
   - Remove deprecated features and replace them with their recommended alternatives.
   - Update any field definitions, model methods, or decorators as required.

2. **Django-Specific Updates:**
   - Replace `NullBooleanField` with `BooleanField(null=True)`.
   - Add the `on_delete` argument to all `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` fields.
   - Update `ugettext_lazy` to `gettext_lazy`.
   - Remove the `@models.permalink` decorator and replace it with recommended logic.
   - Align with `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'` if applicable.

3. **Python Updates:**
   - Remove legacy practices that are no longer needed in Python 3.12.
   - Ensure any iterable or mapping imports use `collections.abc`.
   - Replace outdated exception handling or utility methods (e.g., `imp` to `importlib`).

4. **Comment Changes:**
   - Clearly comment on each update, explaining what was changed and why, for transparency.

5. **Save Results to File:**
   - Save the updated code chunk to a file named `updated_model_chunk.py`.
   - If multiple chunks are processed, append each chunk to the same file for consolidated results.

6. **General Validation:**
   - Ensure the updated code adheres to Django 5.0 best practices.
   - Verify proper formatting for readability and maintainability.

## Code:
Paste your code chunk below. It could be:
- A full `models.py` file.
- A single class or a subset of classes.
- A set of methods or fields.

```python
<<<code>>>
```

---

## Deprecation Timeline:
### Django 5.0:
1. `NullBooleanField` has been removed. Use `BooleanField(null=True)` instead.
2. Explicit `on_delete` argument is required for `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField`.
3. `ugettext_lazy` â†’ `gettext_lazy`.

### Additional Notes:
- Full deprecation timeline details already provided earlier.
- The `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting must align with the global Django project configuration.

---

## Expected Output:
The rewritten code chunk will:
1. Be compatible with Django 5.0 and Python 3.12.
2. Replace deprecated features with their modern equivalents.
3. Include comments explaining all changes.
4. Be saved to a file (`<<<file_name>>>`) for easy reference.

---

### Example Workflow:
1. **Input:** A single class or a method from `models.py` provided as a code chunk.
2. **Process:** Update and comment on changes while ensuring compatibility.
3. **Output:** Save the updated code to `<<<file_name>>>`.
