# Prompt for Upgrading Python Code with Django Mix

## Task:
Review and rewrite the provided **code chunk** from a Python file, which may include Django 1.11 code, to make it fully compatible with **Django 5.0** and **Python 3.12**.

### Requirements:
1. **Review and Update:**
   - Analyze the provided code, whether it is a full Python script or a partial chunk, and rewrite it for compatibility with Django 5.0 and Python 3.12.
   - Update deprecated Django features, methods, or modules to their modern equivalents.
   - Ensure Python 3.12 compliance by replacing outdated imports, methods, or syntax.

2. **Django-Specific Updates:**
   - Replace `NullBooleanField` with `BooleanField(null=True)`.
   - Add the `on_delete` argument to all `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField` fields.
   - Update `ugettext_lazy` to `gettext_lazy`.
   - Remove the `@models.permalink` decorator and replace it with modern alternatives.
   - Align with `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'` if applicable.

3. **Python-Specific Updates:**
   - Replace `collections.Iterable` and similar imports with `collections.abc`.
   - Migrate deprecated modules like `imp` to `importlib`.
   - Modernize code by applying updated exception handling and syntax improvements from Python 3.12.

4. **Comment Changes:**
   - Clearly comment on each update, explaining what was changed and why.

5. **Save Results to File:**
   - Save the updated code chunk to a file named `updated_python_chunk.py`.
   - If multiple chunks are processed, save each chunk to separate files or append to the same file as specified.

6. **General Validation:**
   - Ensure the updated code adheres to Django 5.0 best practices and Python 3.12 standards.
   - Verify proper formatting for readability and maintainability.

## Code:
Paste your code chunk below. It could be:
- A full Python file.
- A Python class or subset of classes.
- A set of functions or methods.

```python
<<<code>>>
```

---

## Deprecation Timeline:
### Django 5.0:
1. `NullBooleanField` has been removed. Use `BooleanField(null=True)` instead.
2. Explicit `on_delete` argument is required for `ForeignKey` and `OneToOneField`.
3. `ugettext_lazy` â†’ `gettext_lazy`.

### Python 3.12:
1. Deprecated `collections` imports like `Iterable` must now use `collections.abc`.
2. `imp` module is fully deprecated; use `importlib` instead.

### Additional Notes:
- Full deprecation timeline details are provided earlier.
- Any logic tied to Django or Python should be refactored for compatibility.

---

## Expected Output:
The rewritten code chunk will:
1. Be compatible with Django 5.0 and Python 3.12.
2. Replace deprecated features with their modern equivalents.
3. Include comments explaining all changes.
4. Be saved to a file (`<<<file_name>>>`) for easy reference.

---

### Example Workflow:
1. **Input:** A single Python class, function, or chunk of mixed Django and Python code.
2. **Process:** Update and comment on changes while ensuring compatibility.
3. **Output:** Save the updated code to `updated_python_chunk.py`.
