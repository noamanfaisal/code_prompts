# Prompt for Upgrading Django Imports

## Task:
Rewrite the `imports` section of the provided `code` file to make it fully compatible with **Django 5.0** and **Python 3.12**.

### Requirements:
1. **Django Imports:**
   - Update imports to align with Django 5.0 standards.
   - Remove deprecated modules and use their recommended replacements.
   - Update any module paths that have changed between Django 1.11 and Django 5.0.

2. **Python Imports:**
   - Ensure compatibility with Python 3.12.
   - Remove deprecated modules or methods, using updated versions where necessary.
   - Use modern best practices, such as:
     - `collections.abc` for importing ABCs (e.g., `Iterable`, `Mapping`).
     - Updated syntax for `importlib`, `pathlib`, etc.

3. **Comment Changes:**
   - Provide comments for all changes made, explaining what was updated and why.

4. **Remove Legacy Syntax:**
   - Replace `from __future__ import` statements, as these are unnecessary in Python 3.12.
   - Update any outdated exception handling or library-specific compatibility layers.

5. **Follow Deprecation Timeline:**
   - Review the Django and Python deprecation timelines provided below to ensure full compliance.

### Code:
```python
<<<code>>>
```

### Deprecation Notes:

#### **Django Import Deprecations:**
1. `ugettext_lazy` → `gettext_lazy`.
2. `django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField` → `django.db.models.JSONField`.
3. `CommaSeparatedIntegerField` has been removed. Use `CharField` with validators instead.
4. GIS-related imports like `OSMGeoAdmin` have been removed entirely.

#### **Python Import Deprecations:**
1. `collections.Iterable` and similar have moved to `collections.abc`.
2. `imp` has been deprecated; use `importlib`.
3. `asyncio.get_event_loop` should be replaced with `asyncio.run` or `asyncio.get_running_loop`.

### Expected Output:
1. Save the updated imports to a file named `<<<file_name>>>`.
2. The content of the file should:
   - Be fully compatible with Django 5.0 and Python 3.12.
   - Remove all deprecated or obsolete imports.
   - Use modern, recommended modules and practices.
   - Include clear comments explaining the changes.

### Example Output File (`<<<file_name>>>`):
```python
# Updated imports for Django 5.0 and Python 3.12
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
from django.db.models import JSONField, CharField

# Removed deprecated CommaSeparatedIntegerField, replaced with CharField and validators.
